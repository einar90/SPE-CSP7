            \item The problem in the paper deals with oil recovery by bottom water drive in a thin reservoir where coning is important. 
        \end{itemize}
        \pause
        \item The purpose of this project was to recreate the results of the SPE CSP7 study; specifically the ECL100 results.
        \item Additionally, modifications were made to the model and the results compared to those of the original model.
