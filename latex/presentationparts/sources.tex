    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data file from course web page\footnote{\url{http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~kleppe/pub/SPE-COMPARATIVE/ECLIPSE_DATA/}} used as starting point.
        \item Properties were modified in some places to fit better with the data in the paper\footnote{Nghiem, Long and Collins, David A. and Sharma, Ravi. \emph{Seventh SPE Comparative Solution Project: Modelling of Horizontal Wells in Reservoir Simulation.} Society of Petroleum Engineers, 1991.}.
        \item The properties section was copied from the Eclipse Technical Description\footnote{Eclipse Techical Description. Version 2013.2, page 655}, which has an LGR example using case 3a from this study.
